# Marlin-Bugfix-2.0.x configuration files for the SKR mini e3 v1.2 board + BLTouch

In this repository are the configuration files I have used in attempt to set up the SKR mini e3 v1.2 board with the Antclabs BLTouch.

6/18/2020 - ~~The probe currently fails after probing the first two points.~~   After reading [this comment](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/17242#issuecomment-605541216) on a bug report, I checked my bed adjustment nuts, and one was loose. I tightened the nut, and the bed leveling worked as expected.
